==========

An iOS app for tracking chores.

Chores are grouped into chore groups. Each housemate is assigned to a chore group. Every week, the groups rotate housemates.

Eventually, you'll be able to remind a housemate that, for example, the dishwasher needs to be emptied, or thank them for emptying it!
